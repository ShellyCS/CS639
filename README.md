<h3 align="center">Part 1 of building Shrine an e-commerce app.</h3>

<h4>

In this codelab, I have built a login page for Shrine that contains:
<ul>
  <li>
    Two text fields, one for entering a username and the other for a password
  </li>
  <li>
    Two buttons, one for "Cancel" and one for "Next"
  </li>
  <li>
    The name of the app (Shrine)
  </li>
  <li>
    An image of Shrine's logo
  </li>
</ul>
